# TEST. VGG19_to_style
Styling an image using RNN VGG 19.
The purpose of the project: to show the transfer of style from a stylized image (X_style) to a base image (X_img). 
To do this, the public architecture of the VGG 19 convolutional neural network was slightly modified. 
The fully connected neural network was removed from this network, but the weights and learning of the network remained the same. 
As a result, the output image (Output) was obtained.
